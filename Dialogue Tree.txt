Text plain with or without [ACTION] is the NPC talking
>  indicates a player reply

[ACTION]You see a human figure working on the reactor.
***TutorialWait - If you haven’t finished the tutorial yet
    [ACTION]They seem to be busy digging around inside. Perhaps you should talk to the captain first.
***After tutorial
[ACTION]On closer observation, the reactor has been repaired with odd-looking crystals.
>[SKIP]...
[ACTION]Noticing you, the figure quickly withdraws from the reactor.
>[SKIP]...
[ACTION]The figure looks androgynous, short, and rather slim.
>[SKIP]...
[ACTION]Something feels a bit off about their appearance.
>Who are you?
>You're that Starwisp I saw before I died. (Skip Dialogue)
    **Skip version
    That's right, we agreed to assist you. I'll call our ship.
    [ACTION]Vatish's form glows momentarily, sending an energy pulse to the reactor.
    >[SKIP]...
    **Skip to below noted as Short Dialogue skip
The name's [NPC_NAME]. Are you one of the crew?
>Yes, I'm a guard, my name is [PLAYER_NAME].
I see! The clone replication system must have actually worked!
>[SKIP]...
It was pretty smashed up. But it's okay. I hotwired it back together!
>Yes, except that I don't remember anything.
There were some broken pieces left over... I did what I could.
>[SKIP]...
You look fine otherwise... I think.
>You aren't part of the crew, are you?
No. I came on board as soon as the pirates left and did what I could.
>Why were you out here in the first place?
I'm aware of your prototype ship, the DF.
>[SKIP]...
I was sent to investigate it, but the pirates got here first.
>What do you know about it?
[ACTION]Vatish’s expression becomes much more serious.
>[SKIP]...
There is powerful alien technology in your 'prototype' ship.
>[SKIP]...
In fact, it never belonged to the humans in the first place.
>[SKIP]...
But somehow, you got a hold of that technology. And what did you do?
>[SKIP]...
You reverse-engineered it into a super-weapon.
>[SKIP]...
It's a threat to every living being in the universe!
>...And the pirates have it now too.
Exactly. They need to be stopped, no matter what.
>I'll stop them any way I can.
If you promise us you will destroy it, the collective will assist you.
>[SKIP]...
It's too dangerous to let fall into pirate hands.
>Collective? What are you talking about?
[ACTION]The human's form vanishes, revealing a glowing orb of plasma in its place.
>What the hell are you?
We are Starwisps. No time to explain, you can ask on the trip if you must.
>[SKIP]...
[ACTION]The creature sends a pulse of energy into the reactor using thin tendrils of plasma.
>[SKIP]...
I called for our ship, they will assist you on your journey.
>Why are you willing to help us?
If that prototype ship isn't destroyed, we may all perish.
>Fair enough.

**Short Dialogue skips to here
[ACTION]Outside of the station there's a bright flash, and a giant crystal ship jumps close.
>[SKIP]...
The S.S Aurora is waiting. Radio Solaria on the comms when you get to your ship.
>[SKIP]...
[ACTION]The starwisp creature reassumes the illusion of a human.
>[SKIP]...
I'll stay behind and send any other surviving crew your way. Good luck.
>Yes, sir! ..lady..thing.
>Thanks!

***Later players joining game aka PUCC
>Hello? (Ask for a ship)
>I'm in a hurry. I need to catch up with my ship. (Skip Dialogue)
    **Jumps to Skip Dialogue below
[ACTION]The androgynous-looking person turns to face you.
>[SKIP]...
Oh! Another survivor! The clone replication system managed to recover you as well.
>I don't remember anything. What's going on?
>I need to join the crew on our ship.
**What's going on?
    The cloning system was damaged, so you didn't recover all of your memories.
    >[SKIP]...
    Long story short, pirates attacked this space station and stole a prototype ship.
    >[SKIP]...
    Your mission is to hunt down the Prototype ship DF and destroy it.
    >[SKIP]...
    The prototype has a super-weapon made using powerful reverse-engineered alien technology.
    >[SKIP]...
    We, the Starwisp collective, agreed to help you in your mission.
    >[SKIP]...
    The DF prototype is a threat to all life in the universe. It must be destroyed.
    >[SKIP]...
    I'm sure your crew can catch you up to speed otherwise...
    >Then I need to join the crew on our ship.
**Join crew
Right... about that. There's no more proper space ships in this sector you can use.
>[SKIP]...
Even if you got one, it could take forever to catch up with your ship.
>[SKIP]...
I did come up with something for you, however!
>What was that?
[ACTION]Vatish gives a grin like a mad scientist.
>[SKIP]...
This space station has a shipyard that makes Prototype Unmanned Construction Crafts.
>[SKIP]...
P.U.C.Cs for short. They weren't meant to be manned, but...
>I'm not sure I like where this is going...
>Uhh...
I modified the blueprints, removed some parts and crammed a life support unit inside.
>[SKIP]...
It's a tight fit, but it's space worthy and very fast, though it lacks a shield generator.
>How would that possibly catch up with our ship?
Well... I've been tinkering, and modified a FTL engine to fit inside it.
>[SKIP]...
I took out all the... 'unnecessary' parts, but it's still quite weak on such a tiny ship.
>[SKIP]...
So I hooked it up to the station and super-charged it with the reactor!
>That can't be safe...
Well... it only needs to work once.
>[SKIP]...
We attached a beacon to your ship so the Aurora can follow it.
>[SKIP]...
I'll program it into the FTL system and the autopilot will follow the ship automatically.
>[SKIP]...
The P.U.C.C is so small it can ride the FTL wake your ship makes when it jumps.
>[SKIP]...
It can also be handy in a dogfight. It's fast and can damage the hull or systems quickly.
>[SKIP]...
But it doesn't have any shields, so make sure to dodge frequently.
>Okay. You really think this will work?
I'm... pretty sure it will work. The P.U.C.C is outside.
>[SKIP]...
    **If used Skip Dialogue
        The P.U.C.C is outside.
        >[SKIP]...
Contact me on the comms when you're ready and I'll install the FTL unit.
>Will do.

**When radioed on comms
>I'm ready. Send the P.U.C.C to the ship!
Okay, make sure you're INSIDE the ship and have already claimed it.
>Wait! I'll get in the ship and claim it.
>Yes, ready to go!
>Fire away! (Skip Dialogue)  **Skips to jump stage instantly
The modified FTL engine is ready, and will engage the moment I install it.
>[SKIP]...
By the way... the ship has a built-in fire suppression and repair system.
>Oh nice!
It'll come in handy if it bursts into flames from the FTL engine. Bon voyage!
>Wait, what?
>Oh, great...
*The ship jumps, during FTL the ship bursts into flames around the HyperDrive
